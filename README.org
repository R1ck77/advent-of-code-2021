My solutions for the Advent of Code 2021, in Emacs LISP (or this is the plan. Let's see how it unfoldsâ€¦)

** How to install the code

Just clone the repository: it doesn't require any setup at all.

** What do you need

- Emacs (obviously) with the following packages installed:
  - buttercup
  - dash
- make (optionally)

** How to run the samples

You can either just type:

#+begin_src shell
make
#+end_src

if you have it, or you can manually run:

#+begin_src shell
emacs --eval "(setq load-path (cons \".\" load-path))" -batch -f package-initialize -f buttercup-run-discover
#+end_src

if you don't .
